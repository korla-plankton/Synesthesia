# 🎛️ Synesthesia: The Sensor-to-Media Toolkit for Android

**Synesthesia** turns your Android device into a fully configurable multimedia instrument by mapping its onboard sensors to **visual effects** and **audio output**. Whether you're an experimental musician, visual artist, or just curious about your phone's capabilities, Synesthesia lets you build expressive, reactive performances with nothing more than your phone.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎵 **Sound Generation & Effects**
  - Map accelerometer, gyroscope, light sensor, proximity sensor, magnetic field, and more to pitch, volume, filter, or triggering samples.
  - Supports synthesized tones and custom samples.
  - Real-time modulation and cross-sensor mapping.

- 🎨 **Visual Feedback**
  - Dynamic visuals (particles, waves, strobes, abstract forms) that respond to sensor input.
  - Fully customizable color schemes and shapes.
  - Project visuals via screen casting for live performance.

- 🧩 **Modular Mapping Interface**
  - No-code drag-and-drop system to link sensors to actions.
  - Save and load presets.
  - Multi-layered mappings for complex interactions.

- 🔄 **Live Performance-Ready**
  - Low-latency response.
  - Background audio thread for uninterrupted sound.
  - Optional fullscreen visual mode with HUD overlay.
